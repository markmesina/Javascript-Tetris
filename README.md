## Javascript-Tetris

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game from the 80â€™s. Try to get your personal high score by moving each of the 5 randomly selected Tetromino shapes sideways and/or rotating by quarter-turns, so that they form a solid horizontal line without gaps. When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. For each line you will receive 10 points.

## Brief
* The game should stop if a Tetrimino fills the highest row of the game board
* The player should be able to rotate each Tetrimino about its own axis
* If a line is completed it should be removed and the pieces above should take its place
* Render a grid-based game in the browser
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, using Github Pages, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Git
* GitHub
